        Blogging has long been a popular way for people to express their passions, experiences and ideas with
        readers worldwide.<br><br>
        A blog can be its own website, or an add-on to an existing site. Whichever option you choose, it serves as a
        space to share your story or market your expertise in your own words, with your own visual language to
        match.<br><br>
        To help create a blog of your own, we’ve compiled this selection of ten blog examples. They’re packed with all
        the design wisdom you need to transform your blog into one of the best in the business.<br><br></p>

        <a class="header" id="header1">01. Zion Adventure Photog</a><br><br>
        <p>When you're first approaching the question of how to start a blog, check out Zion Adventure Photog. The
        blog has a dual purpose: owner Arika’s photography portfolio and establishing her expertise of the Zion area.
        With these, she’s able to make money blogging.<br><br>
        The blog’s ruggedly playful green and yellow color scheme evokes nature and sunshine. The blog’s
        homepage features visual testimonials of happy clients enjoying their adventures. She embeds her
        Instagram Feed directly onto her site, spreading the word about her service and drawing people deeper into
        her brand.<br><br>
        The blog design mirrors its content in depth and expertise. Detailed posts provide detailed guidance on
        activities such as canyoneering and hiking. From the written content, it’s clear that Arika is an expert in her
        field, and the visuals confirm her photography skills.<br><br></p>

        <br><br><a class="header" id="header2">02. Mrs. Space Cadet</a><br>
        <p>On this blog’s My Story page, the creator explains how she couldn’t find an online space that featured
        anything other than people’s perfect marathon training journeys. In response, she created this wonderfully
        authentic blog highlighting her, “Running through life one struggle at a time.”<br><br>
        The top fold features an image of the creator wearing crooked glasses and running on a treadmill with roller
        skates—a perfect embodiment of her blog title. Her site features individual pages for her blog, podcast and
        online store and includes links to her social media, all areas where she shares her incredibly relatable content<br><br></p>

        your online brand. She dishes out fashion and beauty advice in her blog posts then helps her audience of

        hovering over each picture, fans can keep her glamorous aesthetic on hand for inspiration.<br><br>
        Take note from this blog example—partnering with an affiliate and linking out to recommended products in
        your posts is a great way to monetize your blog, as you’ll earn a commission for every sale that comes
        through your site<br><br></p>
